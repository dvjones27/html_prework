Once you have completed the Pre-Work​ HTML and Pre-Work​ CSS​ tasks, 
    create a website using text, 
    lists, 
    include at least two links, 
    two different images and 
    a form. 

Use as many different CSS styles to help design your website. 

We would like you to create a website that tells us about you. 

You can include any text, or images on your website. 

We would like you to talk about yourself, 
    your background, 
    hobbies and 
    why you want to become a web developer. 

Make it as elaborate as possible.  
This can NOT be a copy of the website we built in the code along.  
Please add your own flair and make a site the represents all that is you.
