                <p><strong text-align: center>Just a little bit about me</strong></p>
                <p>Hello. I am
                    <strong>Danunetta Jones</strong>. I began my career in chemistry and have been in chemistry greater than 16 years. While working in chemistry, I realized that my passion changed a bit, and started the process of changing careers. I
                    am currently working to complete my coding bootcamp and have completed more education to assure that I understand the experience and education needed to efficiently code. Once, I have completed the bootcamp, Iexpect that I will find
                    a great career as a Engineer. Thus far, I have enjoyed being in Computer Science and am looking forward to continue improving my skills to become a better Engineer and create many wonderful applications, programs and designs!

                <p>This section gives a brief insight to some activities I have ventured into outside of my career. I like traveling and have traveled just a bit. I had the opportunity to travel to Thailand and have included some images here and more in
                    the
                    <a href=vacations.html>Vacations</a> section. I have traveled to many states in the U.S. however, I do not have images of many of those ventures. Currently, I live in Virginia and am enjoying and learning the area. I am excitingly
                    anticipating my next destination and look forward to see what and where the future leads me. </p>
